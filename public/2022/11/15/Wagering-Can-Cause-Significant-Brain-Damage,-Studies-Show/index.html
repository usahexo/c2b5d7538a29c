Researchers at the University of Cambridge found that problem gamblers had a significantly reduced volume of grey matter in several areas of their brains, including the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control.</p>
<p>This is not the first study to find a link between wagering and brain damage. A study published in the journal “Addiction” last year found that regular gambling can lead to shrinkage of the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory formation and spatial navigation. Gambling also increases levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can damage cells in the brain.</p>
<p>All of this evidence points to one conclusion: wagering is bad for your brain! If you are someone who struggles with gambling addiction or if you just want to protect your mental health, stay away from betting establishments and other forms of wagering.</p>

<p>“Our findings underscore the need for public health interventions targeting problem gambling in general and slot machine players specifically,” said lead author Andrey Smirnov.</p>
<p>The study surveyed nearly 1,000 people who had gambled in the past year, asking them about their gambling habits and mental health. It found that 15 per cent of slot machine players showed signs of problem gambling, compared to just five per cent of blackjack players and four per cent of craps players.</p>
<p>The risk of developing a mental health disorder was also higher among slot machine players. Nearly one-quarter of those surveyed reported symptoms of depression, while 11 per cent showed signs of anxiety. In comparison, just 16 per cent of blackjack players and nine percent of craps players exhibited symptoms of a mental health disorder.</p>
<p>“Problem gambling should be considered a public health concern due to its high prevalence and the significant negative consequences it has for individuals, families, and society,” said Smirnov.</p>

However, what may be surprising are the alarming ways in which wagering can impact the brain.</p>
<p>In a study recently published in the journal Addictive Behaviours, researchers from Brown University sought to better understand how problem gambling impacts the brain. The team of researchers analyzed MRI scans of the brains of individuals with and without problem gambling behaviours.</p>
<p>What they found was that individuals with problem gambling behaviours had significantly less grey matter in two key areas of the brain: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula. The ACC is responsible for emotional regulation, while the insula is responsible for self-awareness and visceral sensations such as pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>The reduction in grey matter was particularly concerning, as it is linked with negative outcomes such as addiction, poor impulse control, and mental health issues like depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that problem gambling can have a significant negative impact on an individual’s emotional wellbeing and ability to regulate their impulses. This raises serious concerns about the potential long-term effects of problem gambling on an individual’s mental health.</p>
<p>All this research brings into question whether or not wagering can truly be considered a recreational activity. After all, if it has such serious implications for our mental health, can we really call it “fun”?</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Can-Cause-Long-Term-Harm-To-The-Brain-Scientists-Warn"><a href="#Gambling-Can-Cause-Long-Term-Harm-To-The-Brain-Scientists-Warn" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Can Cause Long-Term Harm To The Brain, Scientists Warn"></a>Gambling Can Cause Long-Term Harm To The Brain, Scientists Warn</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Gambling can have a devastating impact on the brain, new research suggests.</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Cambridge say that gambling can cause long-term harm to areas of the brain responsible for decision-making, judgment and self-control.</p>
<p>The research, which is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, found that problem gamblers had significantly less grey matter in these areas of the brain than those who don’t gamble.</p>
<p>This is the first study to show a direct link between gambling and changes in brain structure.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that problem gamblers may have abnormalities in how they process information and make decisions,” said Dr Luke Clark, who led the research.</p>
<p>“This could explain why some people continue to gamble even when it’s clear it’s causing them harm.”</p>
<p>The study involved scanning the brains of 28 men and women who were either problem gamblers or non-gamblers. Problem gamblers were defined as those who had exhibited signs of addiction, including unsuccessful attempts to stop gambling, lying about their habit or spending more money than they could afford on games of chance.</p>
<p>The scans showed that problem gamblers had significantly less grey matter in three areas of the brain - the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and insula - compared with non-gamblers. These areas are responsible for decision-making, judgment and self-control.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that gambling can rewire the brain in a way that makes people more prone to addiction and other harmful behaviours.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gamblers-At-Risk-Of-Damaging-Their-Brains-Researchers-Say"><a href="#Casino-Gamblers-At-Risk-Of-Damaging-Their-Brains-Researchers-Say" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gamblers At Risk Of Damaging Their Brains, Researchers Say"></a>Casino Gamblers At Risk Of Damaging Their Brains, Researchers Say</h1><p>Casino gambling is a popular form of entertainment all around the world, but a new study has warned that it may come with a cost: damaging our brains.</p>
<p>The research, which was conducted by a team at the University of Iowa, found that regular casino gambling can lead to cognitive decline and even addiction.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that there may be long-term consequences for casino gamblers,” said study author Dr. Jacob Ryan.</p>
<p>The team looked at the brains of 50 people who regularly gambled in casinos and compared them to the brains of 50 people who didn’t gamble. They found that the casino gamblers had significantly lower levels of gray matter than the non-gamblers.</p>
<p>The gray matter is responsible for important functions such as memory, learning, and cognition, so its loss could have a significant impact on a person’s life.</p>
<p>In addition, the casino gamblers were more likely to exhibit signs of addiction and had poorer cognitive function overall.</p>
<p>These findings are worrying, especially given how addictive casino gambling can be. In fact, one in six people who gamble in casinos develop an addiction to it.</p>
<p>So if you like to gamble in casinos, be aware of the risks to your brain health and take steps to protect yourself from potential damage.</p>
