<p>While some casinos are likely to jump at the opportunity to offer sports betting, tribal casinos may be hesitant because of a federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>“We would certainly want to offer that product,” said casino CEO Frank Fahrenkopf. “But we’re going to have to sit down with our tribes and see if they want to participate in it.”</p>
<p>The Seminole Tribe, which operates seven casinos in Florida, has not commented on their plans for sports betting.</p>
<p>State lawmakers have estimated that sports betting could bring in $500 million in annual revenue. That number is likely high, but even a fraction of that amount would be a windfall for the state.</p>
<p>Casinos would be able to keep a percentage of the bets as well as tax revenue from the sportsbooks. The other big winner would be the state’s education system, which would get a portion of the tax revenue.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have been quick to pass legislation authorizing sports betting now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of New Jersey. That state had argued that a federal ban on sports betting was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Governor Rick Scott has already said he plans to sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>“I’m glad the Supreme Court has sided with New Jersey and I look forward to signing this bill into law,” Scott said in a statement.</p>
<p>  Legislators in Florida have wasted no time in passing a bill legalizing sports betting now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of New Jersey. Governor Rick Scott says he plans to sign it into law, which would make Florida the latest state to allow gambling on sporting events. But who will take the bets?

<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-in-Florida"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction on the rise in Florida"></a>Gambling addiction on the rise in Florida</h1><p>Gambling addiction has become a real problem in Florida, as evidenced by the increasing number of calls to gambling addiction help lines. Gambling addiction is a type of impulse-control disorder, which means that people with this condition have difficulty resisting urges or temptations.</p>
<p>People with gambling addiction may feel an intense urge to gamble, and they may find it difficult to control their betting habits. They may also experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling, such as financial problems, relationship issues, and even legal troubles.</p>
<p>While anyone can develop a gambling addiction, certain factors may increase the risk. For example, people who are vulnerable to addictive behaviors may be more likely to develop a gambling addiction. Additionally, people who have psychiatric disorders or problems with substance abuse are also at risk.</p>
<p>If you think you or someone you love may have a gambling addiction, it’s important to seek help. There are several options available for treating gambling addiction, including therapy and medication. Treatment can help you learn how to manage your urges and stay in control of your betting habits.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-casinos-see-increase-in-profits-with-legal-sports-betting"><a href="#Florida-casinos-see-increase-in-profits-with-legal-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Florida casinos see increase in profits with legal sports betting"></a>Florida casinos see increase in profits with legal sports betting</h1><p>With the legalization of sports betting in Florida, casinos are reporting an increase in profits. The six casino resorts in the state brought in a combined $13 million in July, up from $9.5 million in July of 2018, according to figures from the state Division of pari-mutuel Wagering.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting has been a windfall for the state’s casinos. The six casino resorts in the state brought in a combined $13 million in July, up from $9.5 million in July of 2018, according to figures from the state Division of pari-mutuel Wagering.</p>
<p>Much of that increase is due to new sports books being opened at casinos throughout the state. The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood was one of the first to offer legal sports betting when it launched its book in late June.</p>
<p>Since then, other properties have followed suit. The Daytona Beach Racing &amp; Card Club introduced its own sports book last week and both Gulfstream Park Racing and Casino and Mardi Gras Casino have books set to open within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The increased profits come as no surprise to industry experts, who had predicted that legalizing sports betting would result in increased revenue for casino resorts. “I think this is going to be a big boost for the casino industry,” said Daniel Wallach, a gaming attorney with Becker &amp; Poliakoff. “Not just because of new revenues generated by wagers placed but also because it will attract new customers.”</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting was seen as a way to help revive Florida’s struggling casino industry, which has been hit hard by competition from neighboring states with more liberal gambling laws. In addition to expanded sports betting, Florida’s casinos are also benefiting from a new law that allows them to offer blackjack and other table games.</p>
<h1 id="State-officials-say-gambling-is-now-a-2-billion-industry-in-Florida"><a href="#State-officials-say-gambling-is-now-a-2-billion-industry-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="State officials say gambling is now a $2 billion industry in Florida"></a>State officials say gambling is now a $2 billion industry in Florida</h1><p>Gambling in the Sunshine State is booming, according to a report released this week by the Florida Division of Pari-mutuel Wagering.</p>
<p>The state agency says gambling is now a $2 billion industry in Florida, up from $1.8 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>Much of the growth is being fueled by casino gaming, which has exploded in popularity since the Seminole Tribe opened its Hollywood casino in 2011. The tribe also operates casinos in Immokalee, Tampa and Brighton.</p>
<p>Pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog races remains popular, accounting for $1.1 billion of the total gambling revenue last year. That’s down from $1.2 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>Slot machines account for the majority of casino revenues, followed by blackjack and other table games.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-sports-betting-may-lead-to-other-forms-of-gambling-being-legalized-in-Florida-as-well"><a href="#Legalized-sports-betting-may-lead-to-other-forms-of-gambling-being-legalized-in-Florida-as-well" class="headerlink" title="Legalized sports betting may lead to other forms of gambling being legalized in Florida as well"></a>Legalized sports betting may lead to other forms of gambling being legalized in Florida as well</h1><p>It has only been a week since the United States Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting, and already there is speculation that this could lead to other types of gambling being legalized in Florida.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to say for sure, there are a number of indicators that this could be the case. For example, just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling, state lawmakers filed a bill that would legalize e-sports betting in Florida.</p>
<p>E-sports betting is a type of gambling where people can bet on the outcomes of video game tournaments. And if it is legalized in Florida, it is likely only a matter of time before other types of gambling are legalized as well.</p>
<p>This is because lawmakers in Florida have been eager to expand gambling in the state for some time now. In fact, they have been trying to legalize slot machines at racetracks and dog tracks for years now, but have been unsuccessful due to strong opposition from voters.</p>
<p>But with sports betting now being legal, it is possible that lawmakers will be able to get approval for other forms of gambling as well. This could potentially include online poker and casino games, which are currently illegal in Florida.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility that lawmakers will try to legalize full-scale casinos in the state. This has been attempted in the past, but has failed due to strong opposition from the Seminole Tribe of Florida.</p>
<p>However, with sports betting now being legal, it may be easier for lawmakers to get approval for casinos from the tribe. And if they are able to do so, it could lead to a major expansion of gambling in Florida.</p>
