For many people, the appeal of the game is its simplicity. With just a few basic rules to follow, anyone can start playing and have a chance to win.</p>
<p>However, even though blackjack is simple, there are still ways to improve your game and make it even more fun and exciting. Here are a few easy tips from Lenz Casino that will help you simplify your game play and increase your chances of winning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always hit on soft 17. This is one of the most important blackjack rules, and it’s definitely something you should always remember. By hitting on soft 17, you give yourself a better chance of improving your hand and avoiding a bust.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs whenever possible. This is another rule that can help you improve your hand and increase your chances of winning. When you split pairs, you essentially double your chances of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts. If you want to take your blackjack game to the next level, using basic strategy charts can be helpful. These charts contain all the right moves to make in any situation, so they’re a great tool for beginners and experienced players alike.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose. This may seem like common sense, but it’s something worth remembering nonetheless. Blackjack is an exciting game, but it’s important not to let your excitement get the best of you! Play within your budget and remember that gambling should always be done for fun, not financial gain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice makes perfect! The best way to improve your blackjack skills is by practicing as often as possible. There are plenty of online casinos that offer free blackjack games, so take advantage of them and learn as much as you can about the game!</p>
</li>

However, some techniques are simpler than others and can be easily applied by players of all levels of experience.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at some of the simplest blackjack techniques that can help you to win more often. We will also discuss how to use these techniques, as well as when they are most effective.</p>
<p>One of the simplest techniques is known as ‘covering’. This involves placing a bet that is equal to or greater than the amount you have previously won on a particular hand. For example, if you have won $10 on a hand, you should place a bet of at least $10 on the next hand in order to cover your previous winnings.</p>
<p>This technique can help you to protect your profits and minimise your losses. It is particularly effective when used in combination with other strategies, such as splitting pairs and doubling down.</p>
<p>Another simple technique is called ‘betting progressive’. This involves increasing your bets incrementally as you continue to win hands. For example, if you start off with a bet of $5, you could increase this to $10 if you win the next hand. If you then lose the following hand, you would reduce your bet back down to $5 for the next hand.</p>
<p>This technique can be used to maximise your profits by increasing your bets when you are winning and reducing them when you are losing. However, it is important to remember that it can also lead to bigger losses if you lose several hands in a row.</p>
<p>A third simple technique that can help you to win at blackjack is called ‘card counting’. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can estimate the odds of getting certain cards later in the game.</p>
<p>Card counting can give you an advantage over the casino by allowing you to make informed decisions about when to increase or decrease your bets. However, it is important to note that this technique requires practice and skill in order to be effective.</p>
<h1 id="Play-blackjack-like-a-pro-with-Lenz’s-easy-to-follow-guide"><a href="#Play-blackjack-like-a-pro-with-Lenz’s-easy-to-follow-guide" class="headerlink" title="Play blackjack like a pro with Lenz’s easy to follow guide!"></a>Play blackjack like a pro with Lenz’s easy to follow guide!</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. In blackjack, each player competes against the dealer, trying to score as close to 21 as possible without going over. The goal is to beat the dealer, not other players. Winning at blackjack starts with learning the basic rules and strategies.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-the-basics"><a href="#Learn-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Learn the basics"></a>Learn the basics</h1><p>The basic objective of blackjack is very simple - to draw cards totaling closer to 21 than the dealer without going bust (exceeding 21). Players are initially dealt two cards and the dealer has one card face up and one down. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are face value, and a king, queen or jack (kings, queens and jacks are all worth 10) are each worth 10 points. After players look at their cards, they must either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). If they go over 21 with their new card total (or “bust”), they lose automatically no matter what the dealer’s total is.</p>
<p>If your first two cards equal 21 (“a blackjack”), you win automatically unless the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case it’s a tie. If your initial cards total more than 21 points, you bust - and lose no matter what the dealer’s hand turns out to be like. The aim is then to create a hand totalling closer to 21 than that of the dealer’s hand without going over 21 - again known as ‘going bust’. Players can hit as many times as they like so long as their total does not exceed 21 but should generally stand once their total reaches 17 or more points. </p>
<p>Card counting is an important skill in blackjack that can help players improve their odds of winning. When done correctly, card counting allows players to assign a point value to every card in the deck - high values assigned to cards that increase the player’s chance of winning (such as 2s through 6s) and low values assigned to cards seen as bad for the player (such as 7s through Ace). The aim is then to keep track of how many high-value and low-value cards have been played so far and adjust playing strategy accordingly. This is not easy however, and may get you banned from some casinos so it’s best avoided if you’re a beginner!</p>
<h1 id="Know-when-to-double-down"><a href="#Know-when-to-double-down" class="headerlink" title="Know when to double down"></a>Know when to double down</h1><p> doubling down means that when you have two facedown cards totalling 11 points or less, you can clap on an extra bet equal to your original stake. You then receive just one more card from which you must stand whether you like it or not! Doubling down gives you a good chance of getting closer to 21 without going bust - but only if you’re confident that adding that extra bet won’t cause you problems later on..</p>

With these tips, you’ll be able to improve your odds of winning and have more fun while playing.</p>
<p>#1: Learn the basic rules</p>
<p>Before you start playing blackjack, it’s important to learn the basic rules. This will help you understand how the game works and give you a foundation for building on your skills. There are a few different variations of the game, so be sure to read up on the specific version you’re playing before you start.</p>
<p>#2: Set a betting limit</p>
<p>It’s important to have a betting limit in place before you start playing blackjack. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money in one sitting and that you stay within your budget. Keep in mind that it’s also important to stick to your limit - if you lose too much money, walk away from the table until you’ve had a chance to cool off.</p>
<p>#3: Know when to hit and when to stand</p>
<p>One of the most important skills for playing blackjack is knowing when to hit and when to stand. If you hit too often, you can quickly deplete your funds; but if you stand too often, you may not get as good of a hand as you could. Be sure to use this guide as well as your own judgement when making decisions at the table.</p>
<p>#4: Don’t underestimate the power of doubling down</p>
<p>Doubling down can be a great way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack - but it’s important not to misuse this strategy. Only double down if you think there’s a good chance of getting another card that will give you a better hand. Otherwise, you’re just risking more money for no reason.</p>
<p>#5: Use card counting as an advantage</p>
<p>Card counting can be a great way to gain an edge over the casino - but it’s not easy nor is it guaranteed to work every time. If you’re interested in using this strategy, be sure to practice extensively and learn all there is about counting cards before placing any real bets.</p>

<li><p>Understand how the game works. The basic aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. Cards are worth their face value, with an Ace counting as either 1 or 11, whichever makes the best hand. A hand that goes over 21 (called “busting”) is a losing hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decide how much you want to bet. Usually, bets are placed by setting chips (or another form of currency) in the betting area in front of your position at the table. The minimum bet at most tables is usually $5, but it can be higher in some casinos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose whether to hit, stand, double down, or split your cards. After looking at your first two cards, you need to decide what to do with them. Here are the basic options:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>-Hit: Take another card from the dealer in hopes of getting closer to 21 point total without busting.</p>
<p>-Stand: Stick with your current total and end your turn.</p>
<p>-Double Down: Double your bet and receive just one more card from the dealer. This is only available on certain hands, like a pair of 9s or 10s.</p>
<p>-Split: If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can choose to split them into two separate hands (meaning you now have two turns). Each new hand will be played out independently, and you must place a bet equal to the original bet for each new hand.</p>
