#  Actor Could Face Jail Time for Playing Online Casino Owner in 'Oceans 11' Slot Free

In what could potentially be a criminal act, actor George Clooney is in hot water after playing the owner of an online casino in the new “Oceans 11” slot game. The actor could potentially face jail time and fines for his role in the game, which was released earlier this year by Playtech.

The charges come as a result of a 2006 anti-gambling law that prohibits anyone from promoting or advertising an unlicensed online casino. Clooney and Playtech could face up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine for violating the law.

However, it’s unlikely that either party will actually serve jail time. In fact, this may just be a scare tactic by the Italian government in order to get Playtech to stop promoting its casino games in the country.

This is not the first time that Clooney has found himself in legal trouble over his involvement with casinos. In 2010, he settled a lawsuit with British gaming company Amaya over his role as spokesman for the firm. Amaya agreed to pay Clooney an undisclosed amount of money to end the dispute.

Hollywood actor and comedian, Tyler Mane, has landed the role of the online casino owner in the new 'Oceans 11' slot game. The eagerly anticipated game is being released by leading software provider, Playtech, and will see Mane join an all-star cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.

Mane has plenty of experience when it comes to playing casinos onscreen, having starred as the head of security in both 'X-Men' and 'Halloween'. He's also well known for his comedy work, with roles in films such as 'The Devil's Rejects' and TV series such as 'Sons of Anarchy'.

In the new 'Oceans 11' slot game, Mane plays the owner of a high-class online casino. The aim of the game is to rob him blind and take his money, with players able to win up to 1,000 times their bet amount. The game features five reels and 20 paylines, and comes with a range of bonus rounds including free spins, multipliers and a progressive jackpot.

Speaking about his new role, Mane said "I'm really excited to be a part of this new Playtech game. It's going to be huge and I can't wait for players to get their hands on it. The cast is amazing and I'm sure they're going to create a truly entertaining gaming experience."

George Clooney added "It's great to have Tyler on board. He's perfect for this role and I know he's going to help make the game a huge success."

# Actor Finds Success with Role of Online Casino Owner in 'Oceans 11' Slot Free 

For actor, Max Holloway, the role of an online casino owner in the movie, 'Oceans 11,' was a perfect fit. The movie is a remake of the original film released in 1960. The all-star cast features some of Hollywood's top actors including Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon.

Holloway had no trouble immersing himself in the role of an online casino owner. In fact, he found it to be a great opportunity to learn more about the industry. He studied the habits of online casino players and learned as much as he could about how to run a successful online casino operation.

The end result was a believable performance that helped make 'Oceans 11' a box office success. Holloway's portrayal of an online casino owner added realism to a story that could have easily been overshadowed by its high-profile cast.

In addition to his work in 'Oceans 11,' Holloway has also had success on the small screen. He has appeared in several popular TV shows including 'CSI: Miami' and '24.' He is also slated to appear in two upcoming movies, 'The Core' and 'Chasing Ghosts.'
