#  Gov. Christie Signs Bill Allowing Online Gambling In New Jersey 

On October 28, 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that allows online gambling within the state. The new law makes NJ the third state in the nation to authorize gambling over the internet, following Nevada and Delaware.

The bill had broad bipartisan support in both chambers of the state legislature. Christie said he signed it because it would help create jobs and generate revenue for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years.

Gambling industry experts estimate that online gaming in New Jersey could generate as much as $1 billion in annual revenue. Under the new law, licensed casinos in Atlantic City will be able to offer online casino games, including blackjack, poker, and slots, to residents of the state.

"Today, we're changing the landscape of gaming in New Jersey by authorizing online gaming," Christie said at a signing ceremony at Drumthwacket, the governor's official residence. "This bill is pivotal for Atlantic City and its surrounding communities."

The new law goes into effect on November 26th.

In a landmark decision, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) has authorized the Golden Nugget Atlantic City to offer full online gambling services to its customers.

The casino received approval on Thursday to offer not only internet poker, but also table games, slots and other casino staples.

The Golden Nugget is the first Atlantic City casino to receive permission to offer online gambling since the state Legislature legalized it in February 2013.

It is unclear when the Golden Nugget will actually begin offering online gambling; a company spokeswoman said it would take some time to get everything in place. But industry experts say the casino could be making money from Internet bets within months.

“This is a watershed moment for Atlantic City and for online gaming in the United States,” said I. Nelson Rose, a law professor at Whittier College in California who specializes in gambling issues. “This means that any casino in New Jersey can now go ahead and offer all forms of gambling, except sports betting.”

John Brennan, senior vice president for global gaming operations at Golden Nugget parent company Landry’s, called the decision “a significant event for our company and for the industry as a whole.” He predicted that many other casinos would soon follow suit.

Golden Nugget is paying an $11 million upfront fee for its licensing and expects to generate about $10 million annually in revenue from its Internet business, according to court documents filed this week as part of its lawsuit against rival TropicanaCasino.com. That would put it among the most profitable New Jersey online casinos.

Brennan said Tropicana was trying to block Golden Nugget's licensure because it was worried about competition. A spokesman for Tropicana declined to comment on the litigation Thursday but said the company planned to offer online gambling soon.


The legalization of online gambling in New Jersey has been a long time coming. Lawmakers first introduced bills to authorize internet betting almost a decade ago, but they repeatedly stalled amid concerns about whether it would lead to more addiction and crime. In recent years, however, attitudes have shifted as states have looked for new ways to generate revenue during tough economic times.

Some casinos already offer some form of internet gambling; players can bet on sporting events or play blackjack and other games on their computers or smartphones from anywhere inside New Jersey's borders. But those activities are limited by what type of games are allowed and which casinos are participating. The DGE's decision on Thursday opens up all forms of casino gambling to any of Atlantic City's 12 casinos licensed to offer it.

#  First U.S. State To License Casino Online? 

Arkansas may soon be the first U.S. State to license casino online. A bill that would allow casinos to operate online in the state was introduced on February 12, 2018, by state Representative Bruce Cozart.

The proposed bill, House Bill 1802, would create a new section of law (5-73-118) authorizing the Arkansas Gaming Commission to license casinos to operate online within the state. The commission would have the authority to establish rules and regulations for casinos operating online, including requirements for background checks on employees, minimum age requirements for players, and other safeguards to protect consumers.

According to Rep. Cozart, the proposal is intended to help combat illegal gambling in Arkansas and generate additional revenue for the state. "This legislation is about consumer protection and generating revenue for our state," said Cozart in a press release announcing the bill. "It will give our citizens an opportunity to play at regulated casino sites rather than risking their money at illegal or unlicensed operations."

The bill has been referred to the House Rules Committee and is currently awaiting further action.

#  Nevada Becomes Second State To License Casino Online 

Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has won a coveted license from Nevada to offer online gambling, making his Las Vegas Sands the second casino company after Caesars Entertainment to be approved to offer Internet betting in the state.

Adelson's $35 billion company plans to offer a full suite of casino games, including poker, through its website, pokerstars.com. The site will be accessible to anyone in the United States who is at least 21 years old.

"This is a significant step in our licensing process and we are excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an exciting and safe online experience," said Jan Jones Blackhurst, executive vice president of communications and government relations for Las Vegas Sands.

Nevada began licensing and regulating online gambling operators in June 2013. So far, eight companies have been approved to offer real-money wagering to Nevada residents, including Station Casinos, Boyd Gaming and South Point Hotel Casino Resort.

Adelson's entry into the market is expected to heat up competition among online casinos, which have been struggling with declining revenues as more people gamble at offshore sites.

#  Delaware Becomes 3rd State To License Casino Online

On Tuesday, Delaware became the third state in the nation to license and regulate casino online gambling after Governor John Carney signed into law a bill that would permit the activity.

The move comes as no surprise, as legislators in Delaware have been working on legalizing casino online gambling for some time now; the House of Representatives first voted in favor of the measure back in June.

"This legislation allows us to tap into an existing market and create new jobs in our state," Carney said in a statement. "It will also generate revenue that we can use to improve our schools and protect our vulnerable populations."

According to estimates from the state, casino online gambling is expected to generate $8 million annually in new revenue. The money will be used to fund initiatives such as increased education spending and subsidies for senior citizens and people with disabilities.

Under the new law, casinos within Delaware will be able to offer their games online, including poker, slots, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. Players must be physically located within the state in order to participate.

The legislation comes at a time when other states are also looking into legalizing casino online gambling. Earlier this year, New Jersey became the first state to do so, followed by Nevada earlier this month. Pennsylvania is also considering similar legislation.

Licensing and regulating casino online gambling has been seen as a way for states to generate new revenue in an era of tight budgets. It has also been seen as a way to help protect consumers from unregulated and illegal operators.
