#  How many people spent more than $1,000 on fantasy athletics betting in 2017?

A recent survey by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) found that 31 percent of fantasy sports players spent more than $1,000 on fantasy sports in 2017. That’s up from 22 percent in 2016.

While the number of people spending big bucks on fantasy sports is growing, the total amount of money being spent is actually down. In 2017, players spent an average of $467 on fantasy sports, compared to $521 in 2016.

So why are people spending more money on fantasy sports even though they’re spending less per person? One reason could be that there are more contests and games available than ever before. In addition, the average prize pool for a contest has also increased from $3,206 in 2016 to $3,769 in 2017.

Many experts believe that the increasing popularity of daily and other short-term fantasy sports leagues is driving the increase in big spenders. These contests are typically more expensive to enter and offer bigger payouts, so they appeal to players who are looking for a bigger return on their investment.

Whether you’re someone who spends a lot or just a little on fantasy sports each year, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks involved. There have been some high-profile cases of cheating and fraud in the world of fantasy sports, so it’s important to make sure you’re playing with reputable providers and using secure payment methods.

In addition, all major platforms are licensed and regulated by respected gambling authorities such as the UK Gambling Commission or the Malta Gaming Authority. This ensures that all platforms operate fairly and in accordance with industry best practices.

#  $1,000 is the average amount spent by fantasy sports enthusiasts each year!

$1,000 may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but for fantasy sports enthusiasts, it’s the average amount spent annually on the hobby. And that number is only expected to go up in the coming years!

So what is it about fantasy sports that has people spending so much money? Well, for starters, there’s the competition. Fantasy sports leagues are all about outsmarting your opponents and coming out on top. And let’s face it – we all love to win.

But it’s not just about winning; it’s also about the camaraderie. Fantasy sports leagues provide a forum for people to come together and talk smack to each other while enjoying their favorite hobby. There’s nothing quite like bragging to your buddies about how you crushed them in their league this year!

And finally, there’s the sense of ownership that comes with playing fantasy sports. When you draft a player, you feel like you own a piece of that player – and you want him to succeed. You want him to put up big numbers so you can brag about him even more!

So if you’re looking for a fun and engaging hobby that will have you spending money like there’s no tomorrow, then fantasy sports is definitely for you!

#  Fantasy sports players are shelling out big bucks for a chance to win big!

In the past, fantasy sports players would only have to pay a few bucks to join in on the fun. But now, in some cases, they are required to spend hundreds of dollars in order to have a chance at winning the grand prize.

Just this year, FanDuel charges $5,600 for its biggest contest! That’s more than most people spend on their rent! Meanwhile, DraftKings is asking for $3,000 just to enter one of its contests.

So what’s driving up the prices? Some say it’s because of all the new regulation around the industry. Others think it has to do with player salaries going up. And some people even believe that the big companies are trying to drive out small operators.

But whatever the reason may be, one thing is for sure: Fantasy sports players are shelling out big bucks for a chance to win big!
