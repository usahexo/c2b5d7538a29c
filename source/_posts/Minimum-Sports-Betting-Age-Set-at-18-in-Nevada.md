#  Minimum Sports Betting Age Set at 18 in Nevada

Nevada has become the first state to set a minimum sports betting age of 18. The new law, which was signed into effect by Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval on Monday, October 16th, will go into effect on January 1st, 2018.

The move by Nevada comes as a response to the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal law that had barred most states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to allow sports betting, while others are still considering legislation.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board announced the new age limit on Wednesday, stating that it was working with the state’s casinos and sports book operators to ensure that they are in compliance.

Most of Nevada’s major casino operators have said that they plan to offer sports betting once the law goes into effect next year. MGM Resorts International has already announced plans for a mobile app that will allow customers in Nevada to bet on sporting events.

Sandoval said in a statement that setting the minimum age at 18 would help protect Nevadans from “harmful impacts” of sports betting. He added that the new law would also help to create jobs and boost tourism in the state.

Supporters of the change argue that it is important to set a minimum age so that minors are not exposed to gambling addiction and other harmful behaviors. Critics say that 18 is too young an age and could lead to underage gambling problems.

So far there has been no word from other states on whether they will follow Nevada’s lead and set a minimum age for sports betting.

#  Illinois Moves to Raise Minimum Sports Betting Age to 21

The debate around gambling has been a heated one in recent years, as lawmakers and the public grapple with how to best protect consumers and prevent addiction. In Illinois, one of the latest states to consider a gambling expansion, the minimum legal age for betting on sports is now 21, up from 18.

The new law was championed by Republican State Rep. Mike Zalewski, who argued that it would help protect young people from developing gambling addictions. "We've all seen what can happen when somebody gets addicted to something at a young age," said Zalewski. "This gives people a chance to grow up a little bit more before they start making some potentially very risky decisions."

Opponents of the measure argued that it would only incentivize young people to bet illegally, but Zalewski pointed to other states that have raised the minimum age for sports betting and seen no such increase in black market activity.

Illinois is one of several states currently considering legislation that would expand gambling beyond its traditional casino and lottery offerings. Many lawmakers see this as a way to bring in much-needed revenue, especially given the state's ongoing budget crisis. But as policymakers weigh these proposals, they are also grappling with important questions about how best to regulate the industry and protect consumers.

#  Iowa Sports Betting Age to Remain at 21

Iowa gambling officials announced this week that the state's sports betting age will remain at 21. The decision came as a bit of a surprise, as many had expected the state to follow in the footsteps of its neighbor, Nebraska, and raise the age to bet on sports from 21 to 25.

Iowa Lottery director Terry Rich said that the agency had weighed all of the pros and cons of raising the age, but ultimately decided that it was not in the best interest of Iowans. "We are confident that our existing age restriction of 21 is appropriate for Iowa," Rich said in a statement.

The decision was applauded by many in the state, including Governor Kim Reynolds, who released a statement saying that she was "pleased" with the news. "Maintaining Iowa's current age limit for sports betting will help protect our youth while also providing an additional entertainment option for adults," she said.

Opposition to the decision was voiced by some members of the gambling industry, who argued that raising the age would drive business to neighboring states. But officials ultimately decided that protecting Iowans was more important than catering to out-of-state businesses.

The Iowa Sports Betting Age will remain at 21.

#  New York Considers Raising Minimum Sports Betting Age

The New York State Gaming Commission is considering a proposal to raise the minimum sports betting age from 18 to 21. NYGC chairman Dean S. Baquet announced the proposal on Wednesday, saying that it was in response to concerns about underage gambling.

“There is growing concern about how young people are introduced to gambling and the potential for addiction and other harmful effects,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)” said Baquet. “This proposal would help protect young people and further ensure that gaming takes place in a responsible and regulated manner.”

Under the proposed rule change, persons aged 18-20 would still be able to bet on horse races, but would not be allowed to wager on any other sporting event. The NYGC will hold a public hearing on the proposal on January 9th, 2019.

The move comes as states around the country are legalizing sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the activity. So far, 10 states have legalized sports betting, including New York.

Critics of the proposal say that it will drive gamblers underground, where they will be more likely to engage in risky behavior. They also argue that betting is already happening among underage individuals, so raising the minimum age won’t do much to deter them.

Supporters of the proposal say that it will help protect young people from developing gambling problems at an early age. They also point out that responsible adults over 21 can already legally bet on sports in New York and other states with legal sports betting.

#  Washington State Considers Lowering Minimum Sports Betting Age

The board of directors for Washington State Gambling Commission is considering a proposal to lower the state’s minimum sports betting age from 21 to 18. If this proposal is passed, it would make Washington one of the youngest states in the US to offer legalized sports betting.

The proposed change is in line with the commission’s efforts to modernize the state’s gambling laws and make them more consumer-friendly. In addition to reducing the minimum sports betting age, the commission is also proposing to legalize online gambling and allow airports to offer gambling services.

Washington’s current minimum sports betting age of 21 is much higher than many other states. In Nevada, for example, the minimum legal age for sports betting is only 18. Colorado and Pennsylvania both have a minimum age of 21, while New Jersey has set the minimum age at 19.

Many people are in favor of reducing the minimum sports betting age in Washington State. They argue that it will help attract younger players, who are increasingly turning to illegal bookies and offshore sites to place their bets. By legalizing and regulating sports betting, the state can create a safe and secure environment for players while also generating tax revenue.

Others oppose reduced minimum sports betting age, arguing that it could lead to addictive behavior and social problems among young people. They maintain that adults should be responsible for making their own decisions about whether or not to gamble responsibly.

No decision has been made yet on whether or not to reduce the state’s minimum sports betting age. The commission plans to hold a series of public hearings on the proposal in early 2019 before making a final decision.
