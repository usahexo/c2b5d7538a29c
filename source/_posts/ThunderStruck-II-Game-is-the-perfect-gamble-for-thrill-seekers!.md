Thunderstruck II is a five-reel online slot game with 243 ways to win. The game is based on the Marvel superhero Thor. It has nine bonus features, four of which are randomly triggered. Thewild symbol is Thor’s hammer, and the scatter symbol is his lightning bolt.

The minimum bet is $0.30 and the maximum bet is $45.00.

The jackpot in the base game is 10,000 coins, and the top jackpot in the free spins bonus game is 1,000,000 coins.

I had never played Thunderstruck II before, but I was familiar with the first one as I had played it at a land-based casino years ago. I decided to give it a go online, and I have to say that I was really impressed! There are so many bonus features that it's impossible to get bored.

The graphics are excellent, and the soundtrack really adds to the excitement of the game. I also love how realistic the symbols look – they definitely capture the spirit of Thor and his world.

One thing I should mention is that this game is definitely for gamblers only! The minimum bet might be low compared to other games, but if you want to have any chance of hitting the jackpots you need to be playing with higher stakes. That said, if you're comfortable with betting big then this game can be incredibly rewarding.

Overall, I highly recommend Thunderstruck II for anyone who loves a good thrill! The combination of great graphics, exciting gameplay and huge potential payouts makes it one of my favorites online slots games.
