#  What constitutes gambling addiction?

Gambling addiction, also known as pathological gambling, is a compulsive disorder that can have serious consequences for both the gambler and their loved ones. Gambling addiction is characterised by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, regardless of the negative consequences.

People with gambling addiction often find it difficult to resist the temptation to gamble, even when they know that it could cause them financial or emotional harm. For some people, gambling can become a way to escape from problems or relieve boredom or stress. However, this type of behaviour can quickly spiral out of control and lead to gambling addiction.

The signs and symptoms of gambling addiction can vary from person to person, but some common characteristics include:

* Feeling the need to gamble more and more money in order to get the same rush or high
* Becoming preoccupied with thoughts of gambling and planning future bets* Lying about how much money has been gambled or lost* Experiencing negative consequences as a result of gambling such as financial problems, relationship issues or job losses* Feeling restless or irritable when unable to gamble
* Needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to feel satisfied
* Repeatedly trying but failing to stop gambling

If you recognise these signs in yourself or someone you know, it is important to seek help from a professional therapist or counsellor.
